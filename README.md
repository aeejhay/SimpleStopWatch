# Stopwatch Web Application

## Overview

This project is a simple, interactive stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a digital display of elapsed time, along with start, stop, and reset functionalities.

## Features

* **Start/Pause:** Starts and pauses the timer, toggling the button text accordingly.
* **Clear:** Resets the timer to zero.
* **Digital Display:** Displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Project Structure

* `index.html`:  The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the stopwatch.
* `style.css`:  The CSS file that contains all the styling for the stopwatch.
* `script.js`:  The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the stopwatch functionality.

## How it Works

1.  **HTML (`index.html`)**

    * Creates the layout with a display and control buttons.
    * Links the CSS (`style.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files.

2.  **CSS (`style.css`)**

    * Styles the display and buttons for a user-friendly and visually appealing design.

3.  **JavaScript (`script.js`)**

    * Implements the stopwatch functionality:

        * Uses `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` to start and stop the timer.
        * Updates the display with the elapsed time.
        * Handles button clicks.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
